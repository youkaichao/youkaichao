### 👋 This is Kaichao You, a tech lover!

I'm a researcher in AI/ML, and participate in open-source projects I use.

### ⚡ Fun fact:

You know what? If you are working with AI/ML, there are probably some lines of code in your computer/server that are written by me!

### Repos I made technical contributions to:

Thanks to the education in Tsinghua University, I’m equipped with full-stack abilities, ranging from low-level (assembly), backend (django) to high-level (deep learning frameworks), frontend (vue). Therefore, I occasionally participate in many open-source projects. Below is an incomplete list of my open-source contributions:
